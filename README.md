##  ✏️ Intro & Goals 

Our major focus will be on giving back power to the user, i.e., focusing majorly on user flexibility.
We'll be building on the following:Then add some concrete goals:

-   [ ] Creating a way to search and sort through files for images of different formatting
-   [ ] Create a layout for image display

## Features:

As there are many exciting features to implement in this project, we would like to go step by step:

-   **Initial Feature:** Our plan is to build a basic application that allows the user to upload their images and group them together.
    -   Major Focus here is on handling large amount of data for a single user.
    -   For this we'll be exploring Apache as well as MongoDB.
    -   Giving the user flexibility to create their own tags and grouping their photos will be an exciting challenge.
    -   Showcase a view with dates, locations.
    -   Add on to this will be making it work for multiple users.
    
-   **Additional Feature:** These are some features that we would love to explore:
    -   Image editing Algorithm to playaround with the image. Firstly, we'll be working on basic features like rotate, crop, etc.
    -   Facial recognition
    -   We can make the thumbnail customizable.
