## Requirement Analysis

The idea is that there will be a web app for a single organization for which multiple photographers will be uploading photos and users will be able to view these photos. Now, these photographers will only have the privilege to upload or delete images from the site.

**Photographers:** Each photographer will have a login ID and password through which they will access the photo book and will be able to upload the photos. Now each photographer will have the feature of removing photos (only the ones they have uploaded). Photographers can even upload multiple images at a time.

**Users:** Users do not need any login credentials to visit the site. They will be allowed to select images. Sort them based on tags (Location/Photographers).

**Fundamental Functions:**

-   Upload Multiple/Batch [1000s] Photos.
-   Display Images as thumbnails.
-   Tag images.
-   Basic formatting/editing of images
-   Sort the photos according to year and then according to tags.
-   Link Sharing, for Public Access

**Users requirements:**

-   Pc with Chrome/Edge [compatibility] and Internet connectivity.
-   User Account: For Uploading and Editing
-   File Specifications: JPEG, PNG

**Product requirements (Technical):**

    Programming Language: Python
